    <h1>SPORTS CAR</h1>
    <h2>The sports car genre is one that is almost as old as the car itself, and it was introduced as a way to inject the speed and excitement witnessed in motorsport events into everyday, road-going cars. In that sense, sports cars have always been characterised by speed, power, and a connected driving experience. But that’s not to say that the best sports cars in India haven’t evolved over time.
Today,its hard to precisely define what a sports car is because the term has been stretched radically, spawning even more exclusive and niche segments like supercars and hypercars, to name a few. While they all offer incredible performance, they differ in key aspects like price, availability, ability, and focus. But sports cars, just like every other segment, need to have their prices, mileage and specifications considered before putting your money down on them. Given all that, there are a few burning questions: Which are the best sports cars available in India? What’s the best sports car for Indian roads? And what are the top 10 sports cars in India?
